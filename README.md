Problem Statement:
The ‘Life Expectancy’ dataset contains information about several health and economic factors 
that contribute to average life expectancy for different countries. It is our aim to study how these 
various factors impact the average life expectancy in the given countries.
Variable information:
Country: Name of the country
Status: Whether the country is Developed or Developing
Adult_Mortality: Mortality rate for age group 15-60 out of every 1000 individuals of the 
population
Infant_Deaths: Number of infant deaths per 1000 population
Hepatitis: Hepatitis B (HepB) immunization coverage for 1-year olds (Percentage)
Measles: Number of reported cases for measles per 1000 from population
BMI: Average Body Mass Index for entire population
Underfive_Deaths: Number of deaths under 5 years of age per 1000 population
Polio: Polio (Pol3) immunization coverage for 1-year olds (Percentage)
Diphtheria: Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) immunization coverage for 1-year 
olds (Percentage)
HIV: Deaths per 1000 live births due to HIV/AIDS (0-4 years)
GDP: Gross Domestic Product per capita (in USD)
Population: Population of the country
Malnourished10_19: Prevalence of malnutrition among children and adolescents for Age 10 to 
19 (Percentage)
Malnourished5_9: Prevalence of malnutrition among children for Age 5 to 9 (Percentage)
Income_Index: Human Development Index (HDI) in terms of national income per capita (index 
ranging from 0 to 1)
Schooling: Number of years of Schooling
Life_Expectancy: Life Expectancy in age for the country
